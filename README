This is a dockerized version of https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory.git
and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git
and db4.8 and https://github.com/warmcat/libwebsockets.git

Look at run.sh for ideas on how to run it


You probably want to run just /usr/local/bin/bitcoind until the blockchain is synced up, then run armory.
